# W4 Quantitative Experiment Plan Review

## Scope

This review gates implementation of
`docs/tmp/2026-08-07-kubernetes-configmap-quantitative-plan.md`. It asks whether
the planned comparison between Kubernetes v1.30.0 `AtomicWriter` and
`namei_ext` is fair, measurable, source-faithful, and useful to the paper. It
does not review or change the paper's RQ wording.

## Round 1: No-Go

The independent review found six implementation blockers:

1. The complete-lifecycle timer did not identify exact start and end states.
2. Timed application work was conflated with exhaustive correctness auditing.
3. Post-state inventories could not support cumulative object-churn claims
   after `AtomicWriter` deleted an old timestamp tree.
4. "Real service lifecycle" overstated the two-known-generation,
   post-acknowledgement subset.
5. Payload width, generated entries, and change fraction were not defined.
6. Ten boots were too weak for the planned bootstrap superiority gate.

The plan was revised to:

- start before any condition-specific filesystem or BPF-map mutation and end
  after an identical rollback consumer acknowledgement;
- use one persistent consumer operation sequence in both conditions and move
  exhaustive inventories, controls, result encoding, cleanup, and dmesg outside
  the primary timer;
- preserve each current `AtomicWriter` timestamp-tree observation before the
  next call can remove it, while reporting live namespace inventories rather
  than unsupported cumulative symlink counts;
- limit feature equivalence to two complete generation inputs known before the
  lifecycle and exclude unseen updates, notification, reload, and kubelet
  propagation;
- define `N` as union leaf paths with deterministic names, bytes, modes, and
  four changed paths at `N=4,16,64,256`; and
- use 20 independent boots, counterbalanced pair and scale order, boot-level
  median log-ratios, and an upper 95% interval below 1.0 as the superiority
  rule.

## Round 2: No-Go

The second review found two specification contradictions:

- the timer text simultaneously assumed an existing per-volume root and timed
  creation of that root; and
- the target table still called live namespace inventory "objects created."

The plan now starts with one existing fresh per-sample parent while all
condition-specific roots and the per-volume cgroup are absent. The target table
reports live visible objects after each state.

## Final Review

The independent final review returned **GO**. The timer state and namespace
inventory terminology are consistent, and no implementation-blocking issue
remains.

Implementation remains subject to a separate claim-to-code-to-raw-evidence
review before the real preflight. A mechanically completed Make target will not
be treated as a scientifically successful result without that review.
